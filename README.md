Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! This is a two player version of the game we all know and love. To start, press the start button! If you want to quit, press the exit button... To choose which character you want to be, either X or O, type in your initials in the text boxes next to Player X and Player O! Once you're done with that, press Play to begin the rounds! The first turn is randomized for each round, with the name of the current player's turn below the board to ensure that everyone has a fair chance. Each click on the board alternates player turns. Play until a player wins in this best two out of three rounds. Remember: A win is counted when the player gets three of their respective character in a row, column, or diagonally!!! If the outcome of a round is a draw, it does not count and the board resets. Once a player wins, the game is redirected to the end screen, announcing the winner and giving you the choice to play again or quit. If you press play again, it will take you the player input screen. We hope you enjoy the digital version of the beloved game we all played growing up!
